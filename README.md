# Code-on-A-Motif-based-Perspective-on-Network-Structure-and-Its-Influenc-On-Epidemic-Behaviour
Code provided is used to test the influence of Triangle-based network motifs on epidemic outcomes and network structure. We imported adjacency matrices generated for networks that were rewired to contain varied numbers of triangle motifs using code by Dr Phillip Knight in MATLAB. See code pref.m, BAplus_TN.m, Barabasinetworks.m and BATplus_generator.m to generate networks. Note the algorithm is approximate we set a number of triangles we desire the network to have and fix mean degree to 3 and the model outputs networks with an approximate number of tr triangles. 

We used python packages networkx and EoN (Kiss, I.Z., Miller, J.C. and Simon, P.L., 2017. Mathematics of epidemics on networks. Cham: Springer, 598, p.31.) to simulate epidemics on our networks. We used 180 networks with 1000 nodes, simulated 30 epidemics on each and considered 6 groups of networks with different approximate numbers of triangles. We calculated epidemic size, peak incidence, time to peak incidence, time to ninty percent of total infections and estimated R_0 values.  We explored structural properties of our networks such as, number of isolated nodes, sub-graphs, degree distributions, clustering, network diameters and path lengths and calculated averages, medians, variance and standard deviations for simulations on each network and per network group.
